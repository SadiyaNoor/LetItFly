# LetItFly

Let it Fly is an app created for those feeling overwhelmed at times.
The app functions as a guided breathing exercise with a timer that times the exhales and inhales of the user, inflating a visual balloon at the same time until it floats to the top of the screen and the exercise is complete. 

The app is coded in JavaScript using react native and live tested using an android simulator. We were also able to download Expo and see the app change in real time on our mobile phones.
